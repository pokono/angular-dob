## Usage

To use Angular DOB, add *angularDob* as a dependency to your AngularJS module or app.

The module ships 2 directives, both of which should be added as attributes to elements. 

* dobValidate
* dobFormat

### dobValidate

Is used for validating fields on the client side. Usage:

```html
    <input type="text" ng-model="blah" dob-validate />
```

For validation to work, the element must have an associated ng-model -value.

#### Optional Parameters
   
**Max Date** - Maximum date that will be considered valid.
```html
    <input type="text" ng-model="blah" dob-validate dob-validate-max-date="yyyy/mm/dd"/>
```

**Min Date** â€” Minimum date that will be considered valid.
```html
    <input type="text" ng-model="blah" dob-validate dob-validate-min-date="yyyy/mm/dd"/>
```

### dobFormat

Is used for formatting fields.

```html
	<input type="text" ng-model="blah" dob-format />
```
	
For formatting to work, the element must have an associated ng-model -value.

#### Optional Parameters

**Format Mode** - Date format mode (string). Default: mm/dd/yyyy
```html
	<input type="text" ng-model="blah" dob-format dob-format-mode="dd/mm/yyyy" />
	<input type="text" ng-model="blah" dob-format dob-format-mode="mm/dd/yyyy" />
```

## Example

See example-folder.

The variable *blah* will get filled with an object like this: 
```js
    {"day":8,"month":10,"year":1986,"text":"10/08/1986"}
```
